# Data Structures Implementation

## Introduction

This project contains implementations of various fundamental data structures.  

The implemented data structures include:

- Lab02 : Linked List
- Lab03 : Stack
- Lab04 : Threaded Binary Tree
- Lab05 : Binary Search Tree
- Lab06 : AVLTree
- Lab07 : maxHeap
- Lab08 : BTree
- Lab09 : Topological sort
- Lab10 : Dijkstra algorithm
- Lab11 : Quicksort
- Lab12 : Disjoint Set (Maze)

Each structure is implemented in C and testable way for educational purposes.

> Due to the nature of the assignment, in-depth explanations are not included in this repository.
